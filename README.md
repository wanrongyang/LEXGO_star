## üìù Introduction

Multiobjective shortest path problems are significantly more challenging than single-objective ones due to the exponential growth in the number of label expansions with solution depth. This repository provides a Python implementation of a new exact label-setting algorithm that returns the subset of Pareto optimal paths satisfying a set of lexicographic goals or minimizing deviation from these goals.

## üöÄ Features

- Exact label-setting algorithm for multiobjective shortest path problems
  
- Efficient search performance through goal-based preferences
- Formal proofs of algorithm correctness
- Performance improvement of up to several orders of magnitude
